## What it does

`implement` builds work that has already been decided. You point it at a [ticket](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/ticket), a [spec](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/spec), or the plan you just agreed in the conversation, and it writes the code, drives [tdd](https://aihero.dev/skills-tdd) at the seams, typechecks as it goes, runs [code-review](https://aihero.dev/skills-code-review) at the end, and commits. The build happens in a git worktree on a branch of its own, made at the start of the run, so your checkout is never the thing being edited.

It never reopens the plan. There is no interview, no clarifying round, no proposal of a different approach. Whatever was settled upstream is the input, and the skill's whole job is to turn that into a commit. That is what separates it from typing "build this" at a fresh [agent](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/agent), which will happily redesign the work while it builds it.

## When to reach for it

You invoke this by typing `/implement` yourself: the agent won't reach for it on its own. It ships with `disable-model-invocation: true`, so no other skill can call it either. Wherever [ask-matt](https://aihero.dev/skills-ask-matt) or [to-tickets](https://aihero.dev/skills-to-tickets) says "then `/implement` per ticket", that is an instruction to you, not something the agent will do unprompted.

Where the work currently lives decides whether this is the right skill:

| The work is… | Reach for |
| --- | --- |
| A ticket on the tracker | `/implement #42`, one ticket per [session](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/session), [clearing](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/clearing) context between tickets |
| A spec, not yet split up, and the build spans sessions | [to-tickets](https://aihero.dev/skills-to-tickets) first, then `/implement` per ticket |
| A spec, and the build is small | `/implement` directly against the spec |
| Only in the conversation you just had, and it's still small | `/implement` right there, in the same window |
| Not written down anywhere yet | [grill-with-docs](https://aihero.dev/skills-grill-with-docs), or [grill-me](https://aihero.dev/skills-grill-me) if there's no codebase |
| One concrete behaviour you want test-first, with no spec | [tdd](https://aihero.dev/skills-tdd) directly |
| Already built, and you want it checked | [code-review](https://aihero.dev/skills-code-review) directly |

The same-session case is worth naming because the skill's own first line doesn't cover it. `SKILL.md` says "the spec or tickets", which nudges the [model](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/model) to go hunting for a file that doesn't exist. If the plan lives only in the thread, say so when you invoke it.

## Prerequisites

`implement` branches off whatever `HEAD` you invoke it from, so be on the commit you want the work to sit on top of. It creates the branch and the worktree itself, and does not ask first.

The worktree is a fresh checkout of tracked files, which means the project has to be buildable from a clean clone plus an install. Anything untracked that the build or the tests need, a `.env`, a local config file, a generated fixture, has to be copied across, and the skill is told to do that. A build step that silently depends on a file nobody tracks is the usual reason a run stalls on step one.

If the tickets came from [to-tickets](https://aihero.dev/skills-to-tickets), the tracker they live on was configured by [setup-matt-pocock-skills](https://aihero.dev/skills-setup-matt-pocock-skills). `code-review` reads the same configuration to find the originating spec at close-out.

## What one run does

A run is six beats, in order:

1. Create the worktree and the `implement/<slug>` branch off your current `HEAD`, then get the project installed and building inside it.
2. Read the ticket or spec and work out the seams.
3. Drive [tdd](https://aihero.dev/skills-tdd) at the pre-agreed seams, one red-green slice at a time.
4. Typecheck often, run single test files as it goes.
5. Run the full test suite once, at the end.
6. Run [code-review](https://aihero.dev/skills-code-review), commit to the run's branch, then report the branch, the worktree path, and the `git worktree remove` line.

The worktree stays on disk when the run ends. Merging it, opening a PR from it, and deleting it are yours to do, which is what makes a run you dislike cheap to discard: remove the worktree, delete the branch, and your checkout never knew about it.

One run covers one ticket. The tickets [to-tickets](https://aihero.dev/skills-to-tickets) produces are tracer-bullet vertical slices sized to fit a single fresh [context window](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/context-window), so the intended rhythm is: clear context, implement one ticket, commit, clear again. Each ticket is self-contained, which is what makes the previous ticket's context disposable.

## Pre-agreed seams

The idea the skill runs on is the **seam**: the public boundary you observe behaviour at, without reaching inside. Tests live at seams. Working at a seam agreed before any code is written is what keeps the tests durable, because the implementation underneath can be rewritten without the tests moving.

The word "pre-agreed" is doing real work, and it is also the skill's weakest joint. Nothing inside `implement` agrees the seams. `tdd` is the skill that asks, and it refuses to write a test at an unconfirmed seam. So in practice the agreement happens either upstream in the spec, or in the first exchange of the run. If it happens nowhere, the precondition never fires and the run quietly becomes "just write the code". Naming the seams in the spec is what stops that.

## Common questions

**It finished, but my ticket is still open and the acceptance criteria are still unchecked.**

Correct, and expected. `implement` has no completion step. It ends at the commit and never touches the work item, confirmed on GitHub Issues and on the local markdown tracker, so it is not a tracker integration problem. It also does not act on the findings `code-review` produced, and does not tick the `- [ ]` boxes on the originating issue. Close the ticket and reconcile the criteria yourself. This bites hardest on a dependency chain, because `to-tickets` defines the frontier as tickets whose blockers are all closed. If nothing gets closed, nothing ever becomes visibly unblocked.

**Can I point it at all my tickets at once, or run several in parallel?**

One invocation still means one ticket: batch dispatch across a ticket queue and [subagent](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/subagent) fan-out are both requested repeatedly, and neither exists. Running several sessions side by side is now survivable, though, because each run takes its own worktree and branch instead of sharing one working directory, one index, and one `HEAD`. That sharing is what produced the worst field report on this skill: a `git commit --amend` in one session landing on another session's commit, a stash vanishing from `refs/stash`, and commits landing on the wrong branch, all in one afternoon across three issues. One thing worktrees do not separate is `refs/stash`, which stays repo-wide, so keep stashing out of concurrent runs. Launching the runs and merging the branches afterwards is still yours to assemble.

**Can it open a pull request instead of committing?**

Not built in, but the branch is already there. The run commits to `implement/<slug>` in its worktree and stops, so opening the PR is one `gh pr create` away and nothing has touched your branch in the meantime. The complaint this answers, that the code lands before anyone has verified it works, used to bite because the commit went straight onto the branch you were sitting on. Now it lands somewhere you can read it first. There is still no PR mode and no configuration flag; ask for the PR in the invocation if you want the run to open one.

**`code-review` says it cannot see my changes.**

`code-review` reviews `git diff <fixed-point>...HEAD`, which excludes staged and working-tree changes. `implement` runs it before committing, so unless an interim commit already exists there is nothing in that diff to review. Multiple people have reported this and it is unfixed on both sides. Commit first, then review against the point you branched from.

Separately, some people deliberately do not want the review inside the run at all, because an agent reviewing the code it just wrote is biased toward its own solution. Running [code-review](https://aihero.dev/skills-code-review) in a fresh session against a fixed point is a legitimate alternative, and is the same reason that skill runs its two axes in separate sub-agents.

**One ticket burned 150k tokens. Am I using it wrong?**

Probably the ticket is too big rather than the skill being misused. A run does codebase exploration, a red-green loop per seam, a full suite, and a review, so a non-trivial ticket exceeding 100k [tokens](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/token) is normal rather than a sign something broke. The lever is upstream: right-size the tickets in [to-tickets](https://aihero.dev/skills-to-tickets) so each fits one fresh window. If a single ticket keeps blowing out, split it rather than raising the [effort](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/effort) level.

**`/implement #2` in a fresh session worked on something completely unrelated.**

`#2` is resolved against whatever numbered list the agent can see, which in a fresh session may be a todo file, a checklist, or another work list rather than the configured tracker. The resolution is confident rather than fail-closed, so the mistake is not obvious until it has started. Pass the full reference, the issue URL or `owner/repo#2`, and ask it to confirm the title back before it begins.

## It's working if

- A `git worktree add` runs before any file is edited, and every command after it runs in that new directory.
- The session reads the ticket or spec and restates what it will build, rather than asking you what to build.
- You can see an actual `/tdd` invocation in the trace, not just tests appearing in the diff.
- Typechecks and single test files run repeatedly during the run, and the full suite runs once near the end.
- Your own checkout is untouched at the end: same branch, same `git status` you started with.
- The run reaches a commit on the run's branch without you prompting it to carry on, and tells you the branch name and worktree path when it stops.
- The diff is one ticket's worth of change: a vertical slice through every layer, not several tickets swept together.

## Where it fits

`implement` is the build step of the main chain, second from the end:

```txt
grill-with-docs → to-spec → to-tickets → implement → code-review
```

Its neighbours are [to-tickets](https://aihero.dev/skills-to-tickets), which produces the tickets it consumes and declares the blocking edges that decide their order; [tdd](https://aihero.dev/skills-tdd), which it drives internally at each seam; and [code-review](https://aihero.dev/skills-code-review), which it runs before committing. It sits downstream of the planning skills and trusts them. It does not re-validate the shape of what it was handed, so a badly-structured map or a horizontally-layered ticket gets built as written.

That trust is why [wayfinder](https://aihero.dev/skills-wayfinder) merges onto the chain at [to-spec](https://aihero.dev/skills-to-spec) rather than looping its map straight into `implement`. Go straight to `implement` from a map only when the effort turned out genuinely small.

[ask-matt](https://aihero.dev/skills-ask-matt) is the router over the whole set when you are not sure which flow you are in.
